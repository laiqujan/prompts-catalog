This repository aims to provide a catalog of prompt patterns for leveraging Generative AI models (e.g., ChatGPT) in software engineering tasks. It compiles prompt patterns reported in the literature (academic papers and gray literature), covering diverse areas such as software architecture design, code generation, bug fixing, code quality assessment, and documentation. Contributions and suggestions are welcome to ensure the catalog remains comprehensive and up-to-date.
