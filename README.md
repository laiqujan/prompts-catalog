This repository provides a curated catalog of prompt patterns for leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) in software engineering tasks. It compiles prompts reported in the literature, covering diverse areas such as software architecture design, code generation, bug fixing, code quality assessment, and documentation. The goal is to support researchers and practitioners in effectively utilizing LLMs to streamline development workflows, improve software quality, and accelerate innovation. Contributions and suggestions for new prompt patterns are welcome to ensure the catalog remains comprehensive and up-to-date.
